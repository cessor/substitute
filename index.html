<a name="substitute" class="anchor" href="#substitute"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Substitute</h1>

<p>A friendly substitute for python mocking frameworks <a href="http://nsubstitute.github.io/">*</a>.
It helps you replace the dependent-on components of a class when you are writing unit tests. It provides what others call Mocks or Stubs. It is loosely based on <a href="http://nsubstitute.github.io/">NSubstitute</a>, my favorite substitution framework for .NET.</p>

<h2>
<a name="creating-a-substitute" class="anchor" href="#creating-a-substitute"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Creating a substitute...</h2>

<p>To use a substitute in your tests simply create it like this:</p>

<pre><code>person = Substitute()
</code></pre>

<h1>
<a name="providing-data" class="anchor" href="#providing-data"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Providing data...</h1>

<p>In order to pass indirect input into the system under test you can either specify some properties or define the data that will be returned when a method is called.</p>

<h2>
<a name="from-properties" class="anchor" href="#from-properties"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>...from properties</h2>

<h3>
<a name="provide-data-as-properties" class="anchor" href="#provide-data-as-properties"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Provide data as properties</h3>

<pre><code>person = Substitute()
person.name = 'Johannes'
</code></pre>

<p>Your system under test probably interacts with its surroundings by calling methods on other objects, some of which don't return anything. An example, as shown below would be calling the 'insert' or 'update' method on a database, or a log method. The calls a system makes can be checked on the substitute, too, and you can also verify that the call was made with the correct values.</p>

<pre><code># Configuration
address = City('London')              # some data
peter = Person(name='Peter', address) # 
address = City('Berlin')              #
jane = Person(name='Jane', address)   # 

database = Substitute()         # Substituting the dependent-on component

people = People(database)       # System under Test
expect_that = assert_true       # Readability is all!
</code></pre>

<a name="about-mocks-and-stubs" class="anchor" href="#about-mocks-and-stubs"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>About mocks and stubs...</h1>

<p>During its lifetime an object will pass values to other components and receive values from them. In your test you want to control these indirect inputs and outputs. Indirect inputs are essentially data that are provided by a component. Indirect outputs (from the system under test) are essentially data that the dependent-on components receive from the system under test. Don't get confused, just always see it from the perspective of the thing being tested. Inputs come in, outputs go out. 
A component that provides canned data as indirect input is often referred to as a 'stub'. Configuring a substitute to provide canned data is especially useful when dealing with 'expensive' resources such as a database or the web. If, for example, you have a web client that parses the data from a website, you might want to provide some fake data to work with, rather than doing real requests to the web. Consider the following example:</p>

<pre><code>class TrelloClient(object):
    def __init__(self, requests):
        self._web = requests
    def all_boards(self):
        response = self._web.get(trello_url).content
        for board in parse(response):
            yield Board.from_document(board)
...
</code></pre>

<p>Here, the (really great) requests module is used to make web requests. Unfortunately, the roundtrip might take a while (overall resulting in very long running tests) and also you don't want your tests to break when there is no internet, for example when you are running them at an airport a hotel right before you are supposed to give a talk at a conference and the wifi goes down all the time. You can easily reduce the impact of the dependency on the web in your test using a substitute:</p>

<pre><code>def test_finding_all_boards():
    '''Finds all boards'''

    # Arrange
    response = Substitute()
    response.content = "{"json": "&lt;...data...&gt;"}"
    web = Substitute()
    web.get.returns(response)

    # System under Test
    client = TrelloClient(web)

    # Act
    boards = client.all_boards()

    # Assert length, content, whatever
    assert_sequence(boards, ...) 
</code></pre>

<h2>
<a name="dont-cross-the-streams" class="anchor" href="#dont-cross-the-streams"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Don't cross the streams...</h2>

<p>You should avoid passing data to a system under test and then also verifying that call was made, like this:</p>

<pre><code>def test_something():       
    calculator = Substitute()
    calculator.cos(0.5).returns(0.8776)
    robot = Robot(calculator)
    robot.rotate_arm()
    expect_that(calculator.cos.received(0.5))
</code></pre>

<p>This test has many problems, one of which being that it doesn't test anything. It tests that the configured call is being made, which it is, when it was configured. Tests like this tend to be very brittle, they mirror the exact implementation. As soon as minor changes occur, they break. Tests should help you detect bad inputs and outputs and tell you when something changes unexpectedly, but they should allow a certain amount of change until they actually break. If they break too often, refactoring code will become very annoying because you can't make any changes at all. Testing is not about mirroring your code in another file, but to provide a safety net. Also they are good to isolate cases of potentially bad values. In a test as shown the system depends on the call being made. If it is made properly, the appropriate return value is given to the sut and the whole thing will run smoothely. There is no need to actually assert that the call is being made. If the configured return value is not obtained, the system will break anyway. If it doesn't - then why are you configuring the substitute to provide values? Try being as specific as necessary and as generic as possible. </p>

<a name="mocks-arent-stubs" class="anchor" href="#mocks-arent-stubs"><span class="octicon octicon-link"></span></a>Mocks aren't stubs...</h1>

<p>Don't believe me? Then read Martin Fowlers great article about the difference: <a href="http://martinfowler.com/articles/mocksArentStubs.html">Mocks Aren't Stubs</a>.
Sometimes a system under test calls methods on other components, without actually caring for a return value. This is often the case for functions that provide sideeffects, such as logging, writing to a file or saving an object to or updating one in a database. 
Checking on these interactions is often referred to as 'verifying expectations on a mock', but I never found the term 'mock' very helpful, therefore I try to avoid it where I can. It is all about verifying the indirect inputs and outputs of a system. Depending on who you ask, people will start confusing you anyway. Some say mock but mean a stub, some say mock but mean a test spy. These are all different things and I encourage you to look up the difference in this book: <a href="http://xunitpatterns.com/">http://xunitpatterns.com/</a> but I try to avoid these terms whenever I can and recommend you do the same. Something goes in, something comes out. Don't call it mock or stub. It doesn't really matter and tests become way more readable when you leave out these weasel words. The basic python mocking tool is actually quite nice, but I don't like the notion of Mock or Magic Mock in it. Yet these are better than what other people have to deal with:</p>

<pre><code>var stubUserRepository = MockRepository.GenerateStub&lt;IUserRepository&gt;();
var stubbedSmsSender = MockRepository.GenerateStub&lt;ISmsSender&gt;();
var theUser = new User{HashedPassword = "this is not hashed password"};    
stubUserRepository.Stub(x =&gt; x.GetUserByName("ayende")).Return(theUser);
</code></pre>

<p>Yeah. I know*.</p>

<p>*) I really respect ayende and have been using the incredible RhinoMocks for ages, but I feel that it has a very steep learning curve. Just like the guys behind NSubstitute I just wanted a different syntax.</p>
